# Everything You Could Eat (eyce)
Everything you can eat is a mod that adds more food to minecraft.
To install go to modrinth @ https://modrinth.com/mod/everything-you-could-eat or download the latest release from here. 
This mod is for neoforge 1.21.1 but neoforge 1.21.4 will come soon.

## How to install:

Get the modrinth app (not required, but easier), install neoforge @ https://projects.neoforged.net/neoforged/neoforge (for minecraft launcher), or use another launcher

For minecraft launcher go to the mods folder (usally located at C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming.minecraft\mods) and download then place the mod there.

For modrinth search for the mod then add to instance

Other launchers, *idk* figure it out

You may not use the textures, as I made all of the textures by myself. Don't redistribute the mod, especially if you will make money from it. If you want the mod on a different platform 
tell me.
